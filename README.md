# Hand Sign Detection

This project implements real-time hand sign detection using MediaPipe for landmark extraction and a RandomForest machine learning model for classification. It supports:

- Collecting hand landmark data via webcam or IP camera
- Training a model on collected data
- Real-time gesture prediction with live video feed

Ideal for beginners learning computer vision and machine learning concepts applied to hand gesture recognition.
